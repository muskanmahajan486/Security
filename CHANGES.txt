Version 0.3 - 2014/08/XX
========================

THIS IS A NON-COMPATIBLE UPDATE TO PREVIOUS 0.2 VERSION
OF THIS LIBRARY.

Update from previous version requires code changes to
update to new API usage:

  - Interface X509CertificateBuilder has been renamed
    to KeySigner

    * Calls to createSelfSignedCertificate(KeyPair, Configuration)
      should be replaced with API call signPublicKey(Configuration).
      Configuration object has been modified to contain the key
      pair used in signing the public key.

  - Class BouncyCastleX509CertificateBuilder has been
    renamed to BouncyCastleKeySigner

  - Class AsymmetricKeyManager has been renamed to
    PrivateKeyManager
    
    * ASN.1 and RSA key related constants, KeyAlgorithm renamed to
      AsymmetricKeyAlgorithm and pushed to KeyManager superclass.  
    * createSelfSignedKey() renamed to addKey()

  - Exception CertificateBuilderException has been
    renamed to SigningException

  - KeyManager abstract superclass rewrite:

    * Constructors have changed.
    * StorageType enum renamed to Storage.
    * init(), save(), load(), add(), remove() have been rewritten 
      to manage internal keystore reference
    * createKeyStore() has been deleted

  - PasswordManager has changed its internal storage format from
    BKS to UBER. It won't load previously saved passwords that
    use BKS storage format by default.


Other changes in this release:

 - KeyManager adds new public size() and contains()
   methods, add() implementation handles also trusted
   certificate storage, new retrieveKey(), getCertificate(),
   generateKey(), getStorageType() and clearPassword()
   convenience  methods added for subclasses. Added
   AsymmetricKeyAlgorithm enum.

 - PasswordManager PasswordNotFoundException is now
   public. API clients can also generate these 
   exception types if necessary.

 - Adds BouncyCastle UBER storage format (recommended
   for symmetric key storage if BouncyCastle provider
   is used).
